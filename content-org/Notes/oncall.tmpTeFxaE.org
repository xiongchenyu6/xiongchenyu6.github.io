* Tips
** how to fix the url problem
One day after I change the dns name for the domain, the url of the grafana oncall show in the slack to jump to the grafana graph is not correct it show the domain before I update rather than the new domain, even if i restart the oncall container or grafana server, neither helps
** fix
Log in to grafana, settings -> plugins -> oncall, then delete the oncall plugins configuration and reconnect to it by type in the oncall domain, finally everything works.
