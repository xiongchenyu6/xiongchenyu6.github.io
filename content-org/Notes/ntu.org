**** What is Artificial intelligence?
***** Intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it
***** The study and design of intelligence agents
- Ability to interact with the real world
to perceive , understand , and act
- Reasoning and Planning
solving new problems and making decisions
ability to deal with uncertainties
- Learning and Adaptation
continuously update of our internal models
**** AI applications
***** Game Playing (Play Chess and Go game)
***** Automatic reasoning and theorem proving (
***** Expert
***** Natural language understanding
***** Robotics
***** pattern recognition
***** Computer vision
** Software engineer
*** What's software
**** Computer programs and associated documentation such as requirements , degin models and user manuals
*** Software products may be
**** Generic - developed to be sold to a range of different customers e.g. PC software such as Excel or Word
**** Customized (or bespoke) - developed for a single customer according to their specification.
New software can be created by developing new programs , configuring generic software system , resunig existing software or a combination of these.
*** Today , software is almost ...
*** Definitions
Software Engineering is the application of engineering to develop quality software in a cost effective way to meet the target objective
*** Role of Software engineer
Programming is the basic essential skill but not enough
Software engineering deals with the development of large and complex system which require the following important skills:

Methods for specifying requirements and design
these methods are called modeling methods ; outputs created by them are called models or specification
These methods cover the creation and analysis of models
Methods for testings system to ensure their quality
Good Knowledge son commonly used software
Communication skills
Management skills
*** Software Process
**** A process is defined as a collection of activities when some work product is
to created . each activity is populated by a set of actions. each action is
defined by a set of tasks to complete the work products and other associated achievement.
** DSP system design
*** General Signal Processing Algorithm
- Waveform generation
- dfs
** Software Engineering EE4001
*** Introduction
*** Water Flow
*** ER model

** Engineering Sociality
- Lecture Outline Tutorial Additional material given.
** Communication
**** witting
- organize the structure
- write what your work
- put sentences properly
- citation
**** presentation
- background
- flow is right, things flow
**** Reflection on the challenge of FYP
The most challenge things is the data preprocessing, the row data is less structured without labeling, I use a lot NLP skills to manipulate the data.
** Digital video processing
*** Shannon-Fano algorithm
无脑排序分堆儿
*** Half man code
*** Lempel-Ziv-Welch Algorithm
**** encode
**** decode
*** JPEG
Sampling -> DCT -> Quantisation -> Zigzag Scanning -> DPCM on DC Component -> RLE on AC Components -> Entropy Coding
**** Sampling
***** 4:4:4 sampling
***** 4:2:2 sampling
for every 3 pixels we get 3 luma samples but only two chrome samples
