* CAP
** ACID
- atomicity
each transaction is treated as a single "unit", which either succeeds completely, or fails completely.
- consistency
Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another
- isolation
Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially.
- durability
Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure
** BASE
- Basically Avaliable
- Soft state
